<h3>August 20, 2010</h3>

<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed trough some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Macig City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences NM.</p>
<h3>July 14, 2012</h3>
<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, When you can´t see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitly won´t be passing any cars</p>
<h3> June 2, 2012</h3>

<p>My first day of the trip! I can´t belive finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I´m on a Segway, I wasn´t able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentails. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles with a Segway."</p>
